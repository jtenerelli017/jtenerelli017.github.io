# Experimenting on the Web
[Here](https://jtenerelli017.github.io/hello-world.html) is a web page that tests website navigation.  
[Here](https://jtenerelli017.github.io/image-size.html) I mess around with image sizing. It demonstrates a smidge of basic HTML and CSS work.  
I also read parts of an article shared in the UD CIS Discord by Dr. Bart (linked [here](https://www.biteinteractive.com/picturing-git-conceptions-and-misconceptions/)). Before reading it, I thought the files I was working on were part of the repository. I learned that I am actually working on a "working tree" and that the repository actually contains snapshots of my files. I'll read more of this article and do further research on Git during the second week.  

# Change Log
Week of 9/5/2021:
- I learned how to link pages between each other using *test.html*. Now I can create multiple web pages to experiment with different skills.
- I learned how to post images with HTML and resize them with CSS.

# TODO
- I want to create an interesting and interactive web page about the Virginia Opossum, my favorite animal. Besides making it informative, I'd also like to add some fun nonsense (like adding a bunch of buttons or something similar) to demonstrate my growing expertise in HTML, CSS, and a few other skills I haven't looked into yet.
