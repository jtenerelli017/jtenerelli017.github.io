# Experimenting on the Web
[Here](https://jtenerelli017.github.io/hello-world.html) is a web page that tests website navigation.  
[Here](https://jtenerelli017.github.io/html-testing.html) is a web page where I test various basic features of HTML.  

# Change Log
Week of 9/5/2021:
- I learned how to link pages between each other using *test.html*. Now I can create multiple web pages to experiment with different skills.

# TODO
- I want to create an interesting and interactive web page about the Virginia Opossum, my favorite animal. Besides making it informative, I'd also like to add some fun nonsense (like adding a bunch of buttons or something similar) to demonstrate my growing expertise in HTML, CSS, and a few other skills I haven't looked into yet.
