# Experimenting on the Web
To enhance my skills as a software engineer, I frequently use the Internet to learn about new strategies (such as how to create a class in CSS) that I eventually implement into my code. To avoid the possibility of plagiarism, I've cited a [list](works-cited.md) of most (if not all) of the websites I have used while programming my own. It will be updated within the weeks leading up to the final submission of my portfolio.

- [Here](hello-world.html) is a web page that tests website navigation.  
- [Here](image-size.html) I mess around with image sizing. It demonstrates a smidge of basic HTML and CSS work.  
- I also read parts of an article shared in the UD CIS Discord by Dr. Bart (linked [here](https://www.biteinteractive.com/picturing-git-conceptions-and-misconceptions/)). Before reading it, I thought the files I was working on were part of the repository. I learned that I am actually working on a "working tree" and that the repository actually contains snapshots of my files. I'll read more of this article and do further research on Git during the second week.  
- I have created a WIP [webpage](opossum-wiki) dedicated to informing readers about the Virginia Opossum.
- [Here](https://jtenerelli017.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) is a React app where you can play a game of Rock Paper Scissors. It's a WIP.

# Change Log
Week of 9/5/2021:
- I learned how to link pages between each other using *test.html*. Now I can create multiple web pages to experiment with different skills.
- I learned how to post images with HTML and resize them with CSS.

Week of 9/12/2021:
- I created a works cited webpage to document a list of websites I use to learn and program my portfolio.
- I made a small improvement to my HTML skills and a moderate improvement to my CSS skills with my creation of an opossum wiki page. Besides creating a new .css file, I have learned to use classes and attributes to style my webpage.

Week of 9/19/2021:
- I created a Tic Tac Toe app using React (but failed to deploy it). The project folder is *my-app* in the source code and it strictly follows [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), so all credit of course goes to the author(s) of that article. This was intended to be a warm-up exercise to be completed before watching Dr. Bart's TA Trainer video tutorial and subsequently before creating a game of Rock Paper Scissors.

Week of 9/26/2021:
- I deployed a React app [here](https://jtenerelli017.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/). It's unfinished but I was at least able to deploy it and fool around with bootstrap and some more CSS. I added buttons, a background image, and some special CSS classes to modify the page.

# TODO
Week of 9/5/2021:
- I want to create an interesting and interactive web page about the Virginia Opossum, my favorite animal. Besides making it informative, I would also like to add some fun nonsense (like adding a bunch of buttons or something similar) to demonstrate my growing expertise in HTML, CSS, and a few other skills I haven't looked into yet.

Week of 9/12/2021:
- I am not satisfied with my work on the opossum wiki, so I will dedicate a portion of the next week on improving it. Specifically, I would like to learn more about and implement features that pertain to text and image alignment such as positioning, padding, and margining. I would also like to implement features pertaining to color such as borders and backgrounds. Finally, I would like to format this webpage in such a way that it is pleasant to look at regardless of the window dimensions. For example, when widening the window, I would like the header image to have a maximum size.
- I would like to make a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors using React.js. At this time, I have not yet learned how to use React, so my first step is to look at the tutorials for it linked on Canvas. From there, I will have a better idea on how I will implement the idea.

Week of 9/19/2021:
- Finish the Opossum wiki. The main source I will use for mastering HTML and CSS will be [Marksheet.io](https://marksheet.io/). I will continue the plans I had in previous weeks.
- Deploy the Tic Tac Toe app. I will try to use [this article](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f) for help + the UD Discord.
- Complete and deploy the Rock Paper Scissors app. My first step is to [watch Dr. Bart's TA Trainer video tutorial](https://youtu.be/q8eYF6cUi5c), and if I need any extra help, I will look back on the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) I used for Milestone 3. [The Hooks tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) linked in Canvas may be useful after I've made good progress on mastering React.
